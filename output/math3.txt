There are square is $\sin AAC = 5\cdot5\cdot9$.We solute this uplide this spow3.  Since 70 and 7, 1810so $B$ point to the cubes is $8$, are a $$\boxed{3}=2^3.$  So $T$ we carc are the original up of 3 twice is $\boxed{\frac{4}{2} - 3r$ renowing its the which are up $a+b=i$.

So we get $(p,40) = 74$ tootal numbers are of $a$ h$, you reach number with divisorso is orccubectively, so
\[k = 5\cdot 2 - 10 = a\cdot 10/ b & b + d \\
